# Arduino-Java-Serial-Port-Communication-GUI
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for serial port communication between an Arduino board and a Java program. The program allows the user to send commands to the Arduino and receive data from it via the serial port. The GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Arduino and visualizing the data it sends.

### Usage
The program will open a window displaying the GUI. Use the drop-down menu to select the serial port to which your Arduino board is connected. Then click the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the board.
